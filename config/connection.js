// Export the connection.js file for our ORM (Object-relational mapping) to use.
// The orm.js then exports its functionality (js code that lets you query and manipulate data 
// from a database using an object-oriented paradigm) so we can use in our controller to run CRUD methods.
// Note: as this file structure has been laid out and the code built within that structure, it is important
// to realize that testing the db connection intially had to be done while in the root of the project folder to
// so that the connection.connect function has access to the node_modules.  When we put the connections.js file
// into the config folder, its now accessed through the modules.exports node functionality and ultimately the 
// ORM relies on being required into the controller file.  In our case, that file is the 
// burgerCntroller.js file.
